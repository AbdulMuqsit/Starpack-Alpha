## Forge Version 36.2.2

Starpack Aleph is back from semi-hiatus.
This update serves as a foundation, so we can get back to a monthly update cycle.
Most of the time was taken by the 4 the new mods I made to make the pack experience better.
See their pages from the links below to understand their features:

## Mods by starmun
* [Just Enough Keys](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-enough-keys)
* [Agricraft Optifine Compat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/agricraft-optifine-compat)

## Important
* If you are do not have enough memory or if you are facing other memory issues, using following java arguments may help

`XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:ParallelGCThreads=4 -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=2147483646 -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=35`

* This version is incompatible with previous worlds, but you can bring in claimed chunks manually to the new world using my Prune Addon mod listed above.
* If you do bring in the old chunks, they may look out of place in the new world.
